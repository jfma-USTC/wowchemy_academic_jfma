My name is Jiefeng Ma, but you may also refer to me as Jeffrey. I am currently in my third year as a PhD candidate at the NERC-SLIP Lab, where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Prof. Du. My research endeavors primarily revolve around document intelligence, multimodal learning, and AI Generated Content (AIGC). 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

As the field of AIGC continues to grow, it encompasses the creation and optimization of content using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. I am dedicated to contributing significantly to this area through rigorous investigation and innovative problem-solving as I progress in my academic pursuits.
